# Zarr Conventions

**EXPERIMENTAL: This org and the repos it contains are experimental and feedback is welcome.**

This organisation contains documentation and tooling to help define and share Zarr Conventions.

## What is a Zarr Convention?

A Zarr Convention is simply a way of using Zarr to store data for a particular domain, application or purpose.
For example, a Zarr Convention can define a set of attributes for storing specific metadata that helps downstream applications provide special behaviour and users interpret the data.

## Define your own convention

To define and share your own convention:

1. [**Create a new GitHub repo** using the zarr-conventions template](https://github.com/new?template_name=template&template_owner=zarr-conventions)
1. **Create a UUID** to use as a globally-unique identifier for your convention. 
1. **Edit the README.md** in your repo to describe your usage convention for developers and users.
1. Optionally, **edit the schema.json** file in your repo to define validation constraints on your metadata.
1. Commit your changes and **make a GitHub release** so you have a stable version of your spec and schema to point to.
1. **Share your convention** with the community (see below).
